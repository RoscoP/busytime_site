The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at <a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.adr.org</a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting BusyTime</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="notice--process">Notice &amp; Process.<a href="#notice--process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Notice &amp; Process." title="Direct link to Notice &amp; Process.">​</a></h3><p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that BusyTime does not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (&quot;Notice&quot;). BusyTime&#x27;s address for Notice is: available upon request via email. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (&quot;Demand&quot;). BusyTime agrees to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if BusyTime does not reach an agreement to do so within thirty (90) days after the Notice is received, you or BusyTime may commence an arbitration proceeding.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fees">Fees.<a href="#fees" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Fees." title="Direct link to Fees.">​</a></h3><p>The payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in King County, Washington, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (30) days of the arbitrator&#x27;s ruling on the merits.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="no-class-actions">No Class Actions.<a href="#no-class-actions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to No Class Actions." title="Direct link to No Class Actions.">​</a></h3><p>YOU AND BUSYTIME AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
